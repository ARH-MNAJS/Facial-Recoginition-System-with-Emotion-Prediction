Welcome to the Facial Recognition System with Emotion Prediction project! This project utilizes the Face API developed by Vincent Muhler to create a powerful facial recognition system that can instantly detect human faces, mark facial features, and predict emotions based on those facial points.

## Key Features

- **Facial Detection**: The system employs advanced algorithms to quickly identify human faces in images or live video feeds, providing seamless facial recognition capabilities.

- **Facial Feature Marking**: With the help of precise facial landmark detection, the system accurately identifies and marks various facial features such as eyes, nose, mouth, and more.

- **Emotion Prediction**: Leveraging TensorFlow models, the system utilizes machine learning techniques to predict the emotional state of individuals based on their facial points. Gain valuable insights into human emotions with reliable predictions.
